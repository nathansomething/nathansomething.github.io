			<h2>Childhood</h2>
	    	<p>I was born and raised in Portland Oregon, in the suburban Bethany Neighborhood. 
	    		My father was a software engineer at Intel and my mother a kindergarten teacher in the nearby Hillsboro School District. 
	    		I also have a brother Josh, who's four years my senior.</p>
			<p>In lieu of my local middle school, I applied and was accepted to Rachel Carson, a magnet school which specialized in environmental science. 
				The curriculum was similar to any other middle school, with one big exception. 
				Every Wednesday, instead of regular classes, we'd go on “Site Visits”, or working field trips with an educational element. 
				For example, we'd go hiking in the Columbia River George and learn about how it was formed by the Missoula Floods, 
				remove invasive species from a nearby wetland to learn about ecosystems, 
				or take water quality readings at a local stream to determine its overall health. </p>
			<p>My experience at Rachel Carson impacted me in so many ways. 
				For one, it instilled upon me a love for nature and the outdoors that has stuck with me every since. 
				Additionally, it showed me first-hand how getting out into the community can make a difference, 
				and gave me a passion for volunteering. 
				But most importantly, Rachel Carson taught me how learning isn't confined to the classroom. 
				You can learn just as much, if not more, by actually going out into the field.</p>
			<p>For high school, I again decided to attend a magnet school, this time SST (Beaverton School of Science and Technology). 
				Like Rachel Carson, the curriculum was similar to a typical high school, but with an emphasis on science classes and science fair. 
				SST is where I really discovered myself. I went in as a shy, socially awkward Freshman but left as a confident, strong, young adult. 
				I decided that I loved math, science, and computers, even when at times those things weren't considered cool. 
				Wanting to get a taste of everything, I tried several clubs at SST, including Drama Club, FIRST Robotics, Mock Trial, School Newspaper, and Ultimate Frisbee. 
				I ended sticking with robotics and Mock Trial through all four years of school.</p>
			<h2>College</h2>
			<p>At the beginning of my junior year of high school, I hadn't the slightest clue where I wanted to go to collage. 
				I had spent my entire life in the Pacific Northwest and, although I love my hometown, I was certainly ready for a change. 
				I first found out about Northeastern at my local college fair. 
				When I heard out about their co-op program, it seemed to be everything I was looking for in a hands-on education. 
				After visiting Northeastern over winter break, I was extremely impressed with the professors and staff that I met. 
				Not to mention I'd fallen in love with the city of Boston and saw it as a place that I'd be happy spending 5+ years. 
				After getting accepted, Northeastern was simply the best fit out of all my schools.</p>
			<p>Since coming to Northeastern I've learned so much. 
				My coursework has challenged me to think in new ways and pushed me to be on top of things. 
				My fellow students have inspired me to be my best and it's been an honor to get to work with so many bright people. 
				In the future, I look forward to taking all of the amazing skills I've acquired over the years and putting them to use to do even more amazing things.</p>
			<h2>My Personality</h2>
			<p>If I had to sum up my personality in a few words, I'd say that I'm “goofy, but serious”. 
				I like to joke around with my friends and take life lightly, but when it comes down to work, I'm focused, determined, and productive. 
				I'm an easy going guy who works well in a team, but I'm also happy to work alone too. 
				I wouldn't call myself outgoing by any means, but I wouldn't say I'm shy either. </p>
			<p>When I'm not coding or catching up with endless amounts of homework, I love to cook, read, hike, bike, and play video games. 
				I also love to travel and see new places. 
				I've been to 23 US States and 5 different countries, most recently to Russia this July. 
				I also find language fascinating, and hope to study more languages in the future.</p>
