    	<h2>Childhood</h2>
    	<p>I was born and raised in Portland Oregon, in the suburban Bethany Neighborhood. 
    		My father was a software engineer at Intel and my mother a kindergarten teacher in the nearby Hillsboro School District. 
    		I also have a brother Josh, who's four years my senior.</p>
		<p>In lieu of my local middle school, I applied and was accepted to Rachel Carson, a magnet school which specialized in environmental science. 
			The curriculum was similar to any other middle school, with one big exception. 
			Every Wednesday, instead of regular classes, we'd go on “Site Visits”, or working field trips with an educational element. 
			For example, we'd go hiking in the Columbia River George and learn about how it was formed by the Missoula Floods, 
			remove invasive species from a nearby wetland to learn about ecosystems, 
			or take water quality readings at a local stream to determine its overall health. </p>
		<p>My experience at Rachel Carson impacted me in so many ways. 
			For one, it instilled upon me a love for nature and the outdoors that has stuck with me every since. 
			Additionally, it showed me first-hand how getting out into the community can make a difference, 
			and gave me a passion for volunteering. 
			But most importantly, Rachel Carson taught me how learning isn't confined to the classroom. 
			You can learn just as much, if not more, by actually going out into the field.</p>
		<p>For high school, I again decided to attend a magnet school, this time SST (Beaverton School of Science and Technology). 
			Like Rachel Carson, the curriculum was similar to a typical high school, but with an emphasis on science classes and science fair. 
			SST is where I really discovered myself. I went in as a shy, socially awkward Freshman but left as a confident, strong, young adult. 
			I decided that I loved math, science, and computers, even when at times those things weren't considered cool. 
			Wanting to get a taste of everything, I tried several clubs at SST, including Drama Club, FIRST Robotics, Mock Trial, School Newspaper, and Ultimate Frisbee. 
			I ended sticking with robotics and Mock Trial through all four years of school.</p>
