    	<p>Welcome to my personal website! Thank you for your interest and taking the time to visit.</p>
    	<p>I am a third year student at Northeastern University pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. 
    		I chose comp sci because of my love for programming I devoloped as early as middle school. 
    		I enjoy the problem solving and challenges that come along with programming, as well as the magic of seeing lines of text on a screen come to life. </p>
    	<p>In addition to Computer Science, I also have a passion for language. 
    		I've taken two linguistics classes in college and I hope to study more if my schedule permits.
    		Additionally, I am studying Russian and am pursuing a minor in Russian Studies</p>
    	<p>I am currently seeking a co-op position between January and June of 2015. 
    		Although I've previously had two technical internships, I am looking forward to my first co-op through Northeastern. 
    		My ideal position would be one which exposes me to new areas of the corporate world, 
    		matches my skill-set while teaching me new skills, 
    		and allows me to go home every evening knowing that I've made a difference.</p>
